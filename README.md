# Mathematical and Algorithmic Trading
Repository for Testing Conceptual Math in Financial Markets

I'm an ECE/Math double major in Duke's Pratt School of Engineering with a Chemistry Minor. I have a keen interest in applying the concepts I learn in my abstract and applied math classes in market and value modeling. This is primarily for proof of concepts, but I'll track any notable returns on here as well. Some of the experiments I will be running will be rigorously based on math and perhaps not always applicable to finance. I will do my best to actualize these experiments in code and algorithms.
